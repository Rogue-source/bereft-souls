# tPackBuilder

---

tPackBuilder is a library mod designed to make it easy to build your own modpacks with little-to-no mod development experience!

The majority of the mod's features can be accessed and utilized through simple `.json` files within your mod.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although this mod aims to abstract away as much coding as possible, certain aspects of tModLoader can only be interfaced through code.

Currently supported features:
- Dynamic recipe changes
- NPC stat changes

Upcoming features:
- NPC item drop changes
- Item/Projectile stat changes
- Modular quest book, designable from an in-game GUI
