This mod merges the Secrets of the Shadows and Fargo's Souls pyramid structures into one cohesive experience, including introducing changes to balancing to better support this.

- The player now always has access to the SotS pyramid.
- The additional Fargo's room has been reworked to spawn as a room in the SotS pyramid.
- All normal SotS content within the pyramid (loot, NPCs) are inaccessible until the world evil boss has been defeated instead of using a key as a progression lock.
- The Pharaoh's Curse debuff is no longer inflicted when within the pyramid.
